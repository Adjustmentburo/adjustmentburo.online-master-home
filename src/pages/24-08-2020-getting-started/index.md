## Most writers aren't very sociable people



This is why we tend to write about other people's lifes, because we stronlgy believe that they are more of 'this' world

I am considerably social, however I am to still trying to understand what makes this world tick.

That got me interested in politics, economics and basic human behaviour. It turned out that I am also a good researcher. Due to the fact that I am able to have an overview and not just think outside the box, but take the box to a whole other level.

I am not bound by one specialism or discipline, and am very strong in analysing on a broader level. That allows me to discover certain facts, that until that time remained ‘hidden’ to the general public. Or as some might say, are deliberately kept out of sight. 

Let me be sure to tell you, that everything in this blog, is my point of view. It is not the absolute truth. Because that is only in the eyes of the beholder.
